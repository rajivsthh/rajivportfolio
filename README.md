    Hi — I'm Rajiv. This repository contains my personal portfolio built with React + Vite (plus a small static copy in `static_portfolio/`).

    ## About me

    - Where I started: I began with web development — building projects with HTML, CSS and JavaScript while learning the fundamentals of front-end engineering.
    - What I'm doing now: I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science student transitioning into cybersecurity. I focus on web application security, penetration testing, and practical network security. I also participate in CTFs and hackathons to sharpen hands-on skills.

    ## Selected projects

    - SEEKHANEPAL — KIST Hackathon: A platform to help students discover interests with interactive demos and an AI chatbot. (Live: https://seekhanepal.vercel.app/)
